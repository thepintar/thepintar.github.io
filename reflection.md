##What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?
I learned that putting certain things into practice is tricker than it initially seems. Adding in a navigation bar with link blocks in it gave me plenty of opportunity to play around with margins and padding, although I decided against borders. Here again however, temporarily adding borders to different elements within the page helped me to easier visualize how my CSS was being interpreted into the actual layout, and I found that very helpful. I also attempted to not use the "<center>" tag, instead trying to utilize CSS whenever possible, and I think I reached an agreeable outcome.

##What did you learn about CSS positioning?
I didn't really update my learning since the second peer pair challenge, but it was helpful to put it into practice again.

##What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?
The easiest thing to implement was the footer nav bar, as I was just replacing a table with some CSS. The most challenging was the upper nav bar, which I found help for online. I was also replacing a table here, but it was challenging to position the background stripe independant of the individual buttons.

##What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?
I attempted to define classes and ids whenever possible, although in the future I'll likely find some further improvments I can make. I learned that some adjustments need to be applied specifically and are not (apparently) inherited. For instance, "text-decoration" needs to be applied at the level of the "<a>" tag for it to work.

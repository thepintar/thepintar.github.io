	<div class="main_text"><h1>About me:</h1>
	<p>I was born in 1985 in Kalamazoo, and from there proceeded to get older until now. That actually makes it sound like I stopped aging. Don't be fooled. I'm getting even older right now!</p>
	<p>I had a near ten year career as a video editor and videographer, which took me around the world and gave me the opportunity to meet and interview all sorts of people, but that job market is getting saturated, and I've said my goodbyes to it.
	</p>
	<p>Growing up, I was lucky enough to have a household computer by the mid nineties. Kid pix, Number Munchers, Carmen Sandiego, The Oregon Trail: if you were there you know what I'm talking about. These were great ways to pass the time in those days, just before the internet really got down to business, and computers really interested me. At school we had a few old Apple IIe's that a couple friends and I found a BASIC programming book for and took to doing some basic coding during lunch. I even managed to find one in a second-hand store for cheap and had it in my room, exploring how to code basic text-based games and dipping my toes into the graphics on that machine, which consisted of a dozen colors and some horizontal and vertical lines.</p>
	<p>That would be it for me for some time though. One Visual Basic course in High School, the only CS related course they offered, would top off my code career until moving to Chicago and enrolling in Dev Bootcamp. Life takes its mysterious twists and turns to get us where we wind up, and I guess I always figured I'd get back to coding somehow. I'm glad to have discovered that, despite my advanced age, I still love to learn and love the challenge of creating solutions from scratch.
	</p>
	<p>And finally, I'm required to tell you something quirky about me. In High School I had a popular (within my class) hip-hop group called Cheezy Mac, who's first single was about mathematical derivatives. Last I heard, they were still playing a song we made for a physics teacher as his walk-on song during school assemblies. And yes, I still rap very well when pressed.

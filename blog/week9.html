 	<h1>The Process</h1>
    <h2>What it do?</h2>

<article class="blog_entry">

        Creating something from nothing is daunting. Creating that thing in an arena visible to the entire world is another situation entirely. And then you've got the coding! Well its enough to give you night sweats. Luckily for me, I've had a great introduction to the process thanks to DevBootcamp.
    </p>
    <p>
    	Starting off the process meant learning HTML, something I'm not a total stranger to. Back in the late 90s I registered for and (for a short time) maintained a geocities website. It wasn't necessary to learn HTML to have a geocities site, but I was interested enough to look into it, and I got the hang of the basic tags. So when I started learning more about web development, the basics came as no surprise. However, I really didn't understand the concept of the DOM, and how to design a modern day web page. It was an eye opener.
    </p>
    <p>
    	The next step of the process was CSS, a completely new concept for me. In checking out the source for different pages online over the years I'd encountered CSS, but never knew how it was implemented, or frankly what it was used for. Its a part of website building that I'd say isn't incredibly complex, but in the nuances available in its use can be powerful. CSS is where I think I stand the most to learn and gain, and where I hope to improve the most over the next month. That said, actually designing and laying out the look of a site isn't the most interesting to me, despite my media arts background. Its something I feel confident in doing, but not something I enjoy as much as I enjoy the logic inherent in Javascript and Ruby.
    </p>
    <p>
    	Javascript and Ruby are the most exciting areas for me, and also the areas I've implemented the least on my site. I have a good understanding of how to implement Javscript in the DOM, but I know theres a lot I have let to learn. This is the area I'm most excited to explore. Every challenge in Javascript and Ruby feels like an adventure.
    </p>
    <p>
    	At the end of the day, theres a lot that goes into communication and creation. Doing it in a way that connects to people requires understanding and mastering the tools required to get there. I'm well on my way to getting there, but I have a ways to go.

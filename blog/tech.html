        This week I'm researching and writing about Rails, oft referred to as Ruby on Rails, which is a web application framework that provides default structures for a database, web service and web pages. Lets be clear, I copied all of that off of Wikipedia, but its a start. Over the rest of this post, I'll clarify what each of these things mean, and let you know why you should be interested in knowing a little bit more about Rails.
    </p>
    <p>
    	Rails was first created by David Heinemeier Hansson in 2004 as a way to make web page creation easier. To be clear, Rails isn't a different language from Ruby, but rather more of a collection of pre-built tools, a framework, that can be used in Ruby to facilitate the back-end creation of a web page. The whole purpose behind Rails is to make your life as a web developer easier by increasing productivity. 
    </p>
    <p>
    	One of the major ways that Rails makes your life easier is by emphasizing Convention over Configuration. Rails has a strict set of naming conventions, for instance, which on one hand limits your options, but on the other hand keeps the syntax simpler. Another one of major ways that Rails makes things easier is by creating a great deal of the structure behind whatever app you're creating right from the outset. This is part of the reason for the naming conventions: in order for Rails to simplify creating all of your directories and reading any new files you create it has to be able to recognize them by name. (i.e. any new controllers must be named using a "name_controller.rb" convention.)
    </p>
    <p>
    	So basically what you need to know is that when you create an app using Rails it will set you up with the full directory that you need to start working on the app. Rails will set up a local server for you so you can test out your app while you run it. You can quickly and easily edit and update individual files by opening the whole directory in sublime text, or whichever text editor you use and see the realtime changes in your browser. You can then modify the html on the front end (with embedded ruby code, using <% code goes here%>) as well as modifying the back end controllers.
    </p>
   <p>
   	So theres a basic rundown of what Rails is, how it differs from Ruby as a whole and why its useful as a web developer.

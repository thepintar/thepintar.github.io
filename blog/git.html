  <h1>A Christmas Miracle: Version Control, git and Github</h1>

        Loyal readers, as the holiday season approaches, I can't help but to think about the year that has passed: the conflicts, the triumphs, the education. As sugarplum fairies dance amongst your dreams, don't forget to stuff your Christmas stockings full of the greatest gift of all: knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
        This brings us to the main topics of today's post. Forgive me, loyal reader, for my verbosity, but the topic bestirs within me a passion for prose. First, allow me to consider the question, "What are the benefits of version control?" Well lets start by imagining a situation you may have encountered in your daily life.
        Have you ever been going about your business, only to think back to some prior circumstance where you feel you made some major error? Have you ever wished you could go back to that time to correct that error, sure within yourself that a small change there would affect the trajectory of your life in a positive way? You aren't alone.
    </p>
    <p>
        Is this a perfect metaphor for version control? No. But it could be useful for you to understand the topic, because if life offered you the same control, you could go back and debug your life, opening up an entirely different future. Incredible.
    </p>
    <p>
        The main benefit of version control is being able to keep new adjustments seperate from your work, to be able to review them before implenting, and to be able to go back and adjust small errors in previous iterations of code. Instead of having to save a multitude of different versions in hopes of not making a grevious error and destroying your work, version control allows you to work parallel to the main code, and only implement changes when you're sure its correct.
    </p>
    <p>
        The second topic of this post is about how git helps one keep track of changes. The answer to this is similarly simple. Git facilitates the simple organization of multiple parallel threads of code, referred to as branches, and also requires one to label each change with a simple description. You can also revisit a log of changes to keep track of where you are and where you've been.
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally, I address why one would use GitHub to store one's code. GitHub has a very simple, in fact ideal graphical interface to represent repositories and branches edited locally, but then stored in the cloud. GitHub makes it simple to store all of your code in a place where it can be accessed from anywhere and then brought down to your local machine for changes to be made. It's really the perfect marriage between convenience and access, and after years of seeing it referenced, I'm excited to understand how it works.
    </p>
    <p>
        So readers, as we enter into this yuletime, I implore you think of those who aren't fortunate enough to utilize the power of git and GitHub, and to pass on the joy of knowledge this season.

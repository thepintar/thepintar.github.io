#Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.

In order to create a new repository on GitHub and clone it to your local computer, first navigate to your user page on GitHub. In the top right corner, locate the Plus sign, click and select "New Repository". Now fill in the required information and click the "Create Repository" button to complete the process. This will take you to the new repository page, where you will need to locate the repository URL. This takes the familiar form of "https://***". Copy this full URL and in your bash shell program, type the command "git clone" and then paste the URL you copied. This will clone the repository to your local machine. Congrats!

#Describe what open source means.

Open Source is essentially just sharing. The author of an Open Source application will release the application as well as its source code so users may customize it or build upon it in whatever way they see fit. The creator still retains copyright for the work, but allows others to use it for their own projects.

#What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

Open Source really appeals to me. If a developer wants to make their work available to everyone in the hopes of allowing the community to build upon and improve their idea, I think its awesome that they can do it. Obviously its not ideal for every circumstance, for instance when an individual or company has invested substantially in creating a great product; however, if each developer looks at themselves as a part of a greater community with the power to make great changes, I think it empowers everyone within the community. It makes me neither nervous nor protective. If I want to protect something I created I won't licence it as open source. Does it feel like utopia? That depends on everyone in the community. There's a chance for it, for sure.

#Assess the importance of using licenses.

Licensing is important as a way of retaining rights to original work while also allowing some degree of freedom to other developers to build upon one's original work. Nobody can claim your original work as their own.

#What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

I wouldn't describe it as an "aha" moment, but certainly being able to practice cloning, branching and pushing once again made me feel a lot more confident about the whole process. There was nothing in particular that caused me struggle.
